## Session — 2026-02-15 (Session 28)
**Focus:** Restore Wave 1 design changes lost to linter reversion

**Accomplished:**
- **Discovered Wave 1 loss**: Previous session's Wave 1 agent changes (CSS, Sidebar, Header) were reverted by the Prettier PostToolUse hook before they could be committed. Wave 2 + Wave 3 changes were intact.
- **Re-implemented all 3 Wave 1 files:**
  - `app.css`: Status semantic colors (`--status-success/info/warning/danger`), Mangomint minimal cards (white borders instead of gold), Boulevard gold-line sidebar active state (`transparent bg + 3px border-left`), sidebar `#161619`, staggered `list-enter` animation (8 child steps), `skeleton-shimmer` gradient, `section-label` + `section-label-gold` utility classes
  - `AppSidebar.svelte`: Grouped `navGroups` array (Communications/Operations/System), `Sidebar.GroupLabel` with `section-label-gold` class, Dashboard standalone at top
  - `AppHeader.svelte`: Notification bell dropdown (missed calls + voicemails, 30s polling), unread count badge (gold), Cmd+K search trigger with `<kbd>` shortcut hint, `timeAgo()` relative time formatter
- **Build passes clean** (only pre-existing a11y warnings)
- **Deployed to Cloudflare Pages** — https://lm-app.pages.dev (commit 2a8b8dc)
- **Pushed to GitHub**

**Files Changed (3 files, +310/-57):**
- `src/app.css` — Status colors, Mangomint cards, Boulevard sidebar, list-enter, shimmer, section labels
- `src/lib/components/AppSidebar.svelte` — Grouped nav with section labels
- `src/lib/components/AppHeader.svelte` — Notification bell + Cmd+K search

**Current State:**
- All 15 design recommendations from Session 27 research now fully implemented and deployed
- All CSS classes referenced by other pages (`list-enter`, `card-elevated`, `section-label`) now defined in app.css
- Wave 1 + Wave 2 + Wave 3 all committed and live

**Next Steps:**
- Visual verification on production (login, navigate all pages, check sidebar grouping, notification bell, Cmd+K)
- Wire up Cmd+K command palette (currently just UI trigger, no modal)
- Phase 1A functional work: call logging completeness, voicemail playback
- Deploy Studio flow to Twilio for after-hours IVR

## Session — 2026-02-15 (Session 27)
**Focus:** Full UI overhaul — Mangomint/Boulevard/Pabau-inspired design improvements

**Accomplished:**
- **Design research**: Studied Mangomint, Boulevard (joinblvd.com), Pabau, and Podium to identify 15 actionable design improvements organized by priority (P0-P3)
- **Parallel sub-agent architecture**: Implemented all 15 changes in 3 waves of concurrent agents, grouped by file dependency to avoid conflicts

- **Wave 1 — Design System Foundation (3 parallel agents):**
  - `app.css`: Status semantic colors (success/info/warning/danger), Mangomint-pattern minimal cards (`card-elevated`), Boulevard gold-line sidebar active state, staggered `list-enter` animation (30ms delay per child), skeleton shimmer, section label utilities
  - `AppSidebar.svelte`: Grouped navigation (Communications, Operations, System) with `section-label-gold` headers, preserved badge polling
  - `AppHeader.svelte`: Notification bell dropdown with unread count (voicemails + messages, 30s polling), Cmd+K search trigger button

- **Wave 2 — Core Page Redesign (2 parallel agents):**
  - `dashboard/+page.svelte`: "Today at Le Med Spa" header with formatted date, `card-elevated` stat cards with sparklines, clinic open/closed pill badge, activity feed section
  - `messages/+page.svelte`: Quick-reply templates (Thanks, Confirm, Hours, Directions), template toggle bar above compose input, enhanced delivery status indicators

- **Wave 3 — Advanced Interactions (2 parallel agents):**
  - `contacts/+page.svelte`: Slide-over drawer replacing inline expand — 420px right-side panel with backdrop, smooth translateX animation, sticky header with large avatar (h-14), all detail sections preserved (tags, calls, form submissions, metadata), `list-enter` on contact list
  - `services/+page.svelte`: Grid card layout (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`), category-colored top borders (gold/emerald/purple), Clock+DollarSign icons, active/inactive badges, hover lift animation, full-width content expansion below grid

- **Build passes clean** — only pre-existing a11y warnings (label associations)
- **Deployed to Cloudflare Pages** — https://lm-app.pages.dev (commit 1f4541e)
- **Pushed to GitHub**

**Files Changed (7 files):**
- `src/app.css` — Design system: status colors, card-elevated, sidebar active state, animations, utilities
- `src/lib/components/AppSidebar.svelte` — Grouped nav with section labels
- `src/lib/components/AppHeader.svelte` — Notification bell + Cmd+K
- `src/routes/(auth)/dashboard/+page.svelte` — Today view, card-elevated, sparklines
- `src/routes/(auth)/messages/+page.svelte` — Quick-reply templates, delivery status
- `src/routes/(auth)/contacts/+page.svelte` — Slide-over drawer, list-enter animation
- `src/routes/(auth)/services/+page.svelte` — Grid cards, category borders, icons

**Design Patterns Applied:**
- Mangomint: Invisible software feel, minimal card borders, surface differentiation
- Boulevard: Gold-line sidebar active state, luxury typography hierarchy
- Pabau: Section grouping, status indicators
- Podium: Unified inbox quick-replies, notification aggregation

**Current State:**
- All 8 pages fully functional with updated design
- Build passes, deployed to Cloudflare Pages
- Committed: `1f4541e` → pushed to GitHub

**Next Steps:**
- Visual verification on production (login, navigate all pages)
- Consider Cmd+K command palette implementation (currently just UI trigger, no functionality)
- Phase 1A functional work: call logging completeness, voicemail playback
- Deploy Studio flow to Twilio for after-hours IVR

## Session — 2026-02-15 (Session 26)
**Focus:** SPECS.md comprehensive update, /capture-specs skill creation

**Accomplished:**
- **SPECS.md accuracy fixes:**
  - Corrected softphone URL param from `?dial=` → `?call=` across 5 references (matching actual code)
  - Fixed IVR main greeting menu options: added "1 = text us (SMS)" that was missing
  - Added IVR business hours table (Mon–Fri 10–6, Sat 10–4 PT, Sun closed)
  - Added operator routing API endpoint detail and fail-safe documentation
- **SPECS.md new sections:**
  - Requirements Capture system (`docs/requirements/`) with 6 page files
  - 4 new Design Decisions Log entries: business hours API, smart message routing, requirements capture, phone normalization
- **Created `/capture-specs` skill** (`.claude/skills/capture-specs/SKILL.md`):
  - Automated workflow: identify changes → read source → update SPECS.md → commit
  - Follows existing format with format rules and safety guardrails

**Current State:**
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub (2 commits: `8d98926`, `fcc4d9b`)
- Working tree clean, up to date with origin/main
- SPECS.md fully accurate with all sessions 1–25 work documented

**Issues:**
- Studio flow JSON updated but NOT deployed to Twilio (needs Flow SID in .env)
- Messages lookup endpoint deployed but not yet tested on production

**Next Steps:**
- Deploy Studio flow to Twilio: `node twilio/deploy.js <FW_SID> twilio/flows/main-ivr-webhooks.json --publish`
- Test after-hours IVR flow (call after 6pm PT or weekend)
- Test smart message routing: click message icon from calls → verify existing conversation auto-selects
- Continue Phase 1C: services catalog content, automation wiring
- Consent form end-to-end testing (sign + submit from phone, verify in DB)

---

## Session — 2026-02-15 (Session 25)
**Focus:** After-hours IVR flow, smart message routing, requirements capture system

**Accomplished:**
- **IVR Studio Flow Update:**
  - Uploaded "Closed text us" audio to Twilio Serverless (lm-ivr-assets-2112.twil.io)
  - Added business hours check API: `GET /api/webhooks/voice/hours-check` (Mon-Fri 10-6, Sat 10-4 PT, Sun closed)
  - Updated Studio flow JSON: press 0 now checks hours → open: operator, closed: play closed greeting
  - Closed greeting: press 1 → SMS, timeout → voicemail recording
  - Flow JSON ready to deploy (needs Flow SID — not in .env yet)

- **Smart Message Routing:**
  - Added `GET /api/messages/lookup?phone=` endpoint — finds existing conversation or contact by phone
  - Messages page now auto-selects existing conversation when navigating from quick action icons
  - If no conversation exists but contact is known, shows contact name in new compose view
  - Phone number field hidden when contact name is displayed
  - URL params cleaned after processing
  - All quick action message links now pass `&name=` param (calls, dashboard, contacts pages)

- **Requirements Capture System:**
  - Created `docs/requirements/` directory with README template and format guide
  - Initial requirement docs for: calls, messages, dashboard, softphone, contacts, IVR flow
  - Each doc captures user stories, acceptance criteria, design specs, API deps, revision history
  - Added "Requirements Capture" section to CLAUDE.md instructing future sessions to maintain it
  - User's exact words quoted in requirement docs for traceability

**Current State:**
- Frontend deployed to Cloudflare Pages (https://lm-app.pages.dev)
- API pushed to Render (auto-deploys from main)
- Studio flow JSON updated but NOT deployed to Twilio yet (needs Flow SID)
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub

**Issues:**
- `TWILIO_PROD_FLOW_SID` not in api/.env — needed to deploy Studio flow via `node twilio/deploy.js`
- Need to test the messages lookup endpoint on production after Render redeploy (~2-3 min)

**Next Steps:**
- Deploy Studio flow to Twilio: `node twilio/deploy.js <FW_SID> twilio/flows/main-ivr-webhooks.json --publish`
- Test after-hours flow (call main number after 6pm PT or on weekend)
- Test message routing: click message icon from calls page, verify it opens existing conversation
- Continue with Phase 1C features: services catalog, automation sequences

---

## Session — 2026-02-14 (Session 24)
**Focus:** Comprehensive frontend design polish — 11 improvements across all pages

**Accomplished:**
- **P0 Fixes:**
  - Contacts: phone-only contacts now show formatted phone as display name (not "Unknown"), avatar shows "#" instead of "?"
  - Settings: replaced emoji tab icons (🕐📞🔀🛡️) with proper Lucide components (Clock, Phone, GitBranch, Shield)
- **P1 Major Improvements:**
  - Login page: complete redesign — split-panel layout with brand visual (left) and form (right), gold ornaments, noise texture, "Private. Intimate. Exclusive." tagline
  - Global texture/depth system: noise texture overlay class, card-elevated with gradient+shadow, page-enter fade-up animation, empty-state-icon gold glow
  - All empty states upgraded across dashboard, contacts, services, softphone, messages, settings — rounded icon containers, Playfair Display headings, better CTAs
- **P2 Polish:**
  - Softphone dial pad: round buttons (was square), gold call button (was green), active press animation
  - Page transitions: fade-up animation on auth layout content area
  - Messages empty pane: radial glow, Playfair heading, gold-bordered "New conversation" button
- **P3 Refinements:**
  - Dashboard: SVG sparklines on Total Calls & Missed Calls cards, enlarged chart (h-36→h-48), card-elevated class
  - Typography: heading weight hierarchy (h1=300 light, h2=400 regular, h3=500 medium)
  - Services: colored left borders by category (gold/emerald/purple), hover transition

**Files Changed (9 files, +293/-70):**
- `src/app.css` — Global animation, texture, card, and typography classes
- `src/routes/(auth)/+layout.svelte` — page-enter animation class
- `src/routes/(auth)/contacts/+page.svelte` — Phone formatting fix, empty state
- `src/routes/(auth)/dashboard/+page.svelte` — Sparklines, card-elevated, empty states
- `src/routes/(auth)/messages/+page.svelte` — Empty pane redesign
- `src/routes/(auth)/services/+page.svelte` — Category borders, empty state
- `src/routes/(auth)/settings/+page.svelte` — Lucide icons, empty states
- `src/routes/(auth)/softphone/+page.svelte` — Round dial pad, gold call button
- `src/routes/login/+page.svelte` — Complete split-panel redesign

**Technical Notes:**
- Svelte 5 restriction: `{@const}` cannot be used directly inside `<svg>` — must use `$derived()` and helper functions instead
- Sparkline SVGs use `<linearGradient>` with unique IDs and `<polyline>` + `<polygon>` for line + fill

**Current State:**
- Build passes, deployed to https://lm-app.pages.dev
- Committed: `84ecd29` → pushed to GitHub
- All 11 design improvements live in production

**Next Steps:**
- Visual verification on production site (login page, dashboard, contacts, softphone, messages, services, settings)
- Consider accessibility audit on new components (color contrast on gold elements)
- Phase 1A functional work: call logging, voicemail playback

## Session — 2026-02-14 (Session 23)
**Focus:** Full Claude Code automation suite — skills, hooks, rules, testing, CI

**Accomplished:**
- **4 Custom Skills** (slash commands):
  - `/deploy` — Build + deploy to CF Pages with automatic retry (up to 3 attempts on network failure), correct `PUBLIC_API_URL`, and post-deploy verification
  - `/verify` — Comprehensive production health check: API health, CORS, frontend, Supabase, public endpoints, webhook endpoints — results in table format
  - `/commit` — Standardized git commit following `[area] Description` format with Co-Authored-By, staged file selection, and auto-push
  - `/migrate` — Supabase migration helper with SQL review, `apply_migration`/`execute_sql`, verification, and advisory checks
- **4 Lifecycle Hooks:**
  - `SessionStart` — Auto-loads latest 2 SESSION_NOTES.md entries + git status as context on startup
  - `PreToolUse (Bash)` — Build guard: blocks `vite build` or `npm run build` without `PUBLIC_API_URL` set to production URL (exit code 2 = block)
  - `PostToolUse (Write|Edit)` — Async build check: runs `vite build` after editing frontend files, reports errors as context without blocking
  - `Stop` — Pre-stop warnings: checks for uncommitted changes, stale SESSION_NOTES.md (>30 min), unpushed commits — feeds into TextMe SMS hook
- **3 Conditional Code Rules** (`.claude/rules/`):
  - `api.md` — Express conventions: supabaseAdmin for server-side, webhook mount order, error/audit patterns
  - `frontend.md` — Svelte 5 runes mandate, shadcn hands-off, dark+gold theme colors, api() wrapper
  - `database.md` — Supabase schema conventions: RLS required, snake_case naming, E.164 phone format
- **Clean Project Settings** (`.claude/settings.json`):
  - Curated permission allow/deny lists replacing 35+ organically accumulated entries
  - All hooks wired via `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` for portability
  - `.gitignore` updated: `.claude/` tracked in git, `settings.local.json` excluded
- **ESLint + Prettier:**
  - ESLint 9 with `eslint-plugin-svelte`, `eslint-config-prettier`, `globals`
  - Prettier with tabs, Svelte plugin, 100-char line width
  - Custom rules: warn (not error) for `no-unused-vars`, `goto()` without `resolve()`, `{#each}` keys
  - 102 warnings + 3 errors in pre-existing code (all new files clean)
- **Vitest + Tests:**
  - 20 unit tests passing: phone formatting (5), phone normalization (5), duration formatting (4), build guard hook (5), stop-check hook (1)
  - API integration test suite (Node.js built-in runner): health, CORS, public endpoints
  - Cross-platform stdin helper for hook testing (`spawnSync` with `input` parameter)
- **GitHub Actions CI:**
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs on push to main and PRs
  - Steps: install deps → lint → format check → type check → build → unit tests → API integration tests

**Files Created (25):**

  - Icons always visible (removed opacity-0 hover-only gate)
  - Border + icon color at 40-60% opacity, hover brightens to full
- **Combined Call Log + Voicemail into single "Phone Log" page** at `/calls`:
  - Segmented toggle (Calls | Voicemails) with gold active state
  - Voicemails tab shows unheard badge count
  - Each view retains its own filters, search, pagination
  - URL param `?view=voicemails` supported for deep linking
  - Stops audio playback when switching away from voicemails
- **Sidebar updated** — removed separate "Voicemails" entry, renamed "Calls" → "Phone Log"
- **Old `/voicemails` route** → redirects to `/calls?view=voicemails` (preserves old links)
- **Dashboard** "Quick Access" voicemail link updated to point to `/calls?view=voicemails`

**Deployed:**
- ✅ Frontend deployed to Cloudflare Pages
- ✅ Build passes clean

**Current State:**
- Sidebar has 8 items: Dashboard, Softphone, Phone Log, Messages, Contacts, Services, Automation, Settings
- Phone Log page merges calls + voicemails with tab toggle
- Contacts page has large Playfair Display names + green phone / blue message icons

**Next Steps:**
1. Test end-to-end: call test number, press 1, verify message appears in messages chat
2. Update production Studio flow (FW839cc419ccdd08f5199da5606f463f87) when test flow verified
3. Continue Phase 1A/1B development

## Session — 2026-02-14 (Session 18)
**Focus:** IVR SMS routing through messages pipeline + contact name source indicators

**Accomplished:**
- **IVR-initiated SMS now routes through our API** — messages appear in the messages chat:
  - Created `/api/webhooks/sms/studio-send` endpoint in `api/routes/webhooks/sms.js`
  - Endpoint: receives caller phone + message body from Studio, sends SMS via Twilio, creates conversation + message records
  - Messages tagged with `metadata: { source: 'ivr' }` for tracking
  - Replaces Studio's built-in `send-message` widget which bypassed our DB entirely
- **Studio flow updated (revision 55)**:
  - Replaced `send_message_accounts` from `send-message` type → `make-http-request` type
  - POSTs to `https://lm-app-api.onrender.com/api/webhooks/sms/studio-send`
  - Sends JSON body: `{ to, body, callSid }` using Studio variables
  - Removed `fcn_NewSMSEmailNotify` (old Twilio Function for legacy email notifications)
  - Made `play_MsgSentGoodbye` terminal (no longer chains to removed function)
- **Script**: `scripts/wire-studio-sms.mjs` for flow JSON modification
- **Contact name source indicators across all pages**:
  - Gold ◆ diamond = known contact from our contacts database
  - Dim "CID" badge = name from Twilio Caller ID (CNAM lookup)
  - No indicator = phone number only (no name available)
  - Updated: Call Log, Dashboard, Voicemails, Messages (conversation list + thread header)
  - Voicemails API now includes `contact_id` + `metadata` in call_logs join

**Deployed:**
- ✅ Studio flow revision 55 published (test flow)
- ✅ API deployed to Render (commits 3c3818d, aa6c659)
- ✅ Frontend deployed to Cloudflare Pages
- ✅ New studio-send endpoint verified: returns proper 400 on empty body
- ✅ Build passes clean

**Current State:**
- **IVR press-1-to-text flow**: Now creates conversation + message in our DB → visible in messages chat
- **Studio flow**: 16 states, all SMS goes through our API
- **Name display**: All pages show name source (DB contact vs Caller ID vs phone-only)
- **API**: `/api/webhooks/sms/studio-send` live on Render

**Next Steps:**
1. Test end-to-end: call test number, press 1, verify message appears in messages chat
2. Update production Studio flow (FW839cc419ccdd08f5199da5606f463f87) when test flow verified
3. Continue Phase 1A/1B development

---

## Session — 2026-02-13 (Session 11)
**Focus:** Softphone call connection fix, ringtone, notifications, sidebar badges, SMS delivery tracking

**Accomplished:**
- **Fixed softphone incoming call connection**: Root cause was missing `accept` event handler — callState was set to 'connected' prematurely before audio was established. Now uses proper event flow: answer → connecting state → accept event → connected state.
- **Added audible ringtone**: Web Audio API dual-tone (440Hz + 480Hz) with ring pattern (0.8s on, 2.2s off). No external audio files needed.
- **Added browser notifications**: Incoming calls trigger OS-level notification even when tab is in background. Auto-closes after 20 seconds.
- **Added microphone permission request on connect**: Asks for mic access when clicking "Connect" (not during a call), preventing silent failures.
- **Added error handling to answerCall()**: Try/catch around accept() with specific error messages for mic permission denied.
- **Added "connecting" UI state**: Yellow transition state between pressing Answer and audio being established.
- **Added unread message badge to sidebar**: Messages nav item shows gold badge with unread conversation count, polls every 15 seconds.
- **Added SMS delivery status tracking**: Outbound messages include statusCallback URL so Twilio sends delivery status updates.
- **Fixed voicemail fallback**: connect-operator-status now includes transcribeCallback + recordingStatusCallback for proper voicemail handling.
- **Verified SMS webhook working**: Tested end-to-end — Render receives SMS, creates conversation + message in Supabase.

**Current State:**
- API running locally on :3001, SvelteKit on :5173
- Render deployed with latest code (commit d1bb3a0)
- SMS webhook verified: `https://lm-app-api.onrender.com/api/webhooks/sms/incoming` → creates conversations + messages
- All 7 pages themed and functional with dark+gold aesthetic
- Softphone now has: ringtone, notifications, proper accept flow, mic permission handling

**Issues:**
- **Softphone audio connection untested end-to-end**: Code fixes are solid but need real call test to confirm audio works
- **SIP credentials blank in local .env** — production has them on Render
- **Frontend not deployed to Cloudflare Pages** — only accessible locally
- **Production Studio flow not updated** — still using old flow

**Next Steps:**
1. Test softphone incoming call end-to-end (call the Twilio number, press 0, verify answer works)
2. Test 2-way messaging end-to-end (send SMS to Twilio number, verify in Messages page, reply)
3. Deploy frontend to Cloudflare Pages for remote access
4. Test SIP routing with real credentials
5. Update production Studio flow once everything is verified

---

## Session — 2026-02-13 (Session 10)
**Focus:** Dark+gold theme, softphone UX, 2-way messaging, operator routing, outbound call logging

**Accomplished:**
- **Dark+gold theme applied to ALL pages**: Dashboard, voicemails, calls, contacts, settings, softphone — all now match lemedspa-website aesthetic (Playfair Display headings, gold #C5A55A accents, hover translateY effects, gold borders)
- **Softphone incoming call UI redesigned**: Large 80px Answer/Decline buttons with labels, blue gradient background, bounce animation, ring glow effects — impossible to miss
- **2-way SMS messaging system built (full feature)**:
  - DB: `conversations` + `messages` tables (migration applied to Supabase)
  - API: `api/routes/messages.js` — list conversations, get thread, send message, stats
  - Webhook: `api/routes/webhooks/sms.js` — incoming SMS + delivery status callbacks
  - Frontend: `/messages` page — conversation list, chat thread, compose, new conversation, 10s auto-refresh, gold-themed chat bubbles
  - Added Messages to sidebar navigation (MessageSquare icon)
- **Outbound call logging**: `/api/twilio/voice` now logs outbound calls to `call_logs` + new `/api/twilio/outbound-status` callback for final status/duration
- **Operator routing cleaned up**: Removed +12797327364 fallback number — now SIP + softphone only. Ring timeout set to 20 seconds.
- **Fixed contacts source CHECK constraint**: Added 'inbound_call' to allow auto-creation of contacts from calls
- **Voicemail tiles reordered**: Main/Care → Lea → Operations → Clinical (was alphabetical)
- **SIP routing added**: `connect-operator` dials `lemedflex.sip.twilio.com` + browser client simultaneously

**Current State:**
- API running locally on :3001, SvelteKit on :5173
- All 7 pages themed and functional: Dashboard, Softphone, Calls, Voicemails, Messages, Contacts, Settings
- Render deploy triggered (3 commits pushed)
- DB migration applied: conversations + messages tables live
- SMS webhook endpoint ready at `/api/webhooks/sms/incoming`

**Issues:**
- **Twilio SMS webhook not configured yet**: Need to point Twilio number's SMS webhook to `https://lm-app-api.onrender.com/api/webhooks/sms/incoming`
- **SIP credentials blank in local .env** — need values from Render (or enter manually)
- **Frontend not deployed to Cloudflare Pages** — only accessible locally
- **Softphone incoming call not connecting** — heard ringing but UI didn't fully connect (may be a Twilio client registration or audio permission issue)

**Next Steps:**
1. Configure Twilio SMS webhook URL in Twilio console → point to Render API
2. Test 2-way messaging end-to-end (send from app, receive reply)
3. Debug softphone call connection issue (audio permissions, client registration)
4. Deploy frontend to Cloudflare Pages
5. Test SIP routing with real SIP credentials
6. Update production Studio flow once everything is verified

---

## Session — 2026-02-13 (Session 9, continued)
**Focus:** Render keep-alive, Studio flow update, browser softphone, Ops voicemail menu, global 0-to-operator

**Accomplished:**
- **Render keep-alive via pg_cron**: Enabled `pg_cron` + `pg_net` in Supabase. Cron job pings Render health endpoint every 5 minutes — server will never spin down again.
- **Studio test flow updated (now revision 52)**:
  - Option 0 → rings browser softphone (client:lea) + fallback phone (+12797327364) simultaneously
  - Option 1 → hours & location
  - Option 2 → more options (company directory)
  - Timeout → also forwards to operator
  - Uses TwiML Redirect to `/api/twilio/connect-operator` for simultaneous ring
- **Browser softphone built**:
  - Backend: `/api/twilio/token` (Access Token with Voice grant), `/api/twilio/voice` (outbound TwiML), `/api/twilio/connect-operator` (simultaneous ring browser + phone)
  - Frontend: `/softphone` page with dial pad, answer/reject/hangup, mute, call duration timer, session activity log
  - Twilio Voice SDK 2.x installed via npm (`@twilio/voice-sdk`), dynamic import to avoid SSR issues
  - Twilio resources created: TwiML App (AP13a23960d285d4bc6bf2a8ad20309534), API Key (SK7dab372468dd0e8d88591eecc156d48f)
  - Added to sidebar navigation with Headset icon
- **Auth user updated**: ops@lemedspa.com profile set to admin role, name "Lea"
- **Diagnosed webhook issue**: Test call webhooks returned 200 but didn't save — Render was asleep during cold start. Fixed by pg_cron keep-alive.
- **Ops vmail Barry uploaded to Twilio Assets**:
  - File: `Ops vmail Barry wav.wav` → `https://lm-ivr-assets-2112.twil.io/assets/Ops-vmail-Barry.wav`
  - Asset SID: ZH2c9a637c7790468a967abb15fd0bb629
  - Build ZB67ffd2a92cd479b2cc8d5bd3727ad8e7 deployed to production environment
- **Accounts/Ops menu updated (revision 52)**:
  - Plays new Barry Ops greeting instead of old Elabs Will recording
  - Digit 1 → sends 2-way text to caller (Ops team)
  - No press / timeout → records voicemail (leave a message)
  - Digit 0 → routes to operator
- **Global digit-0 operator routing**: Pressing 0 from ANY menu (main, hours, directory, accounts) now routes to operator/care team
  - Fixed hours menu (digit 0 was dead-end, now routes to operator)
  - Fixed company directory (digit 0 was dead-end, now routes to operator)
- Added `TWILIO_ASSET_SERVICE_SID` to api/.env
- Committed and pushed to main

**Current State:**
- API running locally on :3001, SvelteKit on :5173
- Render deploy triggered (pushed to main)
- Softphone page loads at localhost:5173/softphone
- Studio flow revision 52 published (all changes above)
- pg_cron pinging Render every 5 min
- Twilio Assets: 7 audio files hosted on lm-ivr-assets-2112.twil.io

**Issues:**
- **Render env vars needed**: Must set these 4 new vars in Render dashboard:
  - `TWILIO_API_KEY_SID` = SK7dab372468dd0e8d88591eecc156d48f
  - `TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET` = v2WjF5RS9VxKRK8sWXPQSlHkm0bxtISa
  - `TWILIO_TWIML_APP_SID` = AP13a23960d285d4bc6bf2a8ad20309534
  - `TWILIO_OPERATOR_FALLBACK` = +12797327364

**Next Steps:**
1. Set the 4 Render env vars (see above)
2. End-to-end test: call +12134442242, navigate all menus, press 0 from different points
3. Deploy frontend to Cloudflare Pages for remote access
4. Update production Studio flow once test passes

---

## Session — 2026-02-13 (Session 7)
**Focus:** TextMe script — finish parseReply() update for smart menus

**Accomplished:**
- Updated `parseReply()` in `~/.claude/scripts/textme.mjs` to match the new menu structure:
  - Option 1: now uses dynamic `option1Prompt` from `inferNextStep()` (e.g. "Commit & keep going" when there are uncommitted edits, "Continue pending tasks" when todos remain)
  - Option 2 (complete menu): changed from "Start new task" → "I'll check the terminal" (Claude stops)
  - Option 3 (complete menu): changed from "Commit & push" → "Commit, push & next task" (commits + continues)
- Added `option1Prompt` field to `analyzeTranscript()` return value for all 4 menu types
- Threaded `option1Prompt` through the full chain: `analyzeTranscript` → `main` → `waitForReply` → `parseReply`
- Verified script passes syntax check (`node --check`)
- Sent test SMS confirming rich context format renders correctly on phone

**Current State:**
- TextMe system fully operational: two-way SMS, smart recommendations, rich context
- All menu types consistent: Option 1 = recommended, Option 2 = terminal/deny, Option 3 = commit+push or terminal
- Script: `C:/Users/LMOperations/.claude/scripts/textme.mjs` (global)
- Hook: `~/.claude/settings.local.json` (global Stop hook, 5 min timeout)

**Issues:**
- None for textme — feature complete

**Next Steps:**
1. Resume lm-app development (Phase 1A deployment or CRM enhancements)
2. RCS setup for patient communications (separate from textme, future)

---

## Session — 2026-02-13 (Session 6)
**Focus:** CRM tags/lists system, contacts frontend overhaul

**Accomplished:**
- Added `tags TEXT[]` and `lists TEXT[]` columns to contacts table (migration 003) with GIN indexes
- Auto-populated tags from existing metadata (migration 004): patient(398), lead(140), partner(9), employee(8), vip(7), friendfam(11), vendor(3)
- Fixed tagging bug: TextMagic-only contacts had source_id set (from TM sync), incorrectly got 'patient' tag. Fixed with targeted SQL.
- Updated `/incoming` webhook to auto-create unknown callers with `unknown` tag + source `inbound_call`
- Enhanced contacts API with tag filtering (`?tag=patient`, `?tags=patient,vip`), list filtering (`?list=diamond`), tag-based stats, tag management (POST/DELETE /:id/tags)
- Rewrote contacts frontend: tag-based filter tabs (color-coded), inline tag badges on cards, inline add/remove tags, collapsible metadata, lists display
- Updated all 3 sync scripts for tag awareness:
  - sync-contacts.js: auto-tags from metadata, merges tags on update
  - sync-textmagic.js: defaults 'lead', smart merge (won't downgrade patient→lead)
  - enrich-from-ar.js: promotes to 'patient', removes 'unknown'
- Simplified login (skip OTP for MVP — go straight to dashboard)
- Updated render.yaml with TextMagic + Twilio env vars
- Added .env-vars to .gitignore (was about to be committed with secrets!)
- Committed and pushed all CRM work

**Current State:**
- Database: 538 contacts (398 patient, 140 lead, 9 partner, 8 employee, 7 vip, 11 friendfam, 3 vendor)
- API: Full CRM-like tag system working locally (port 3001)
- Frontend: Contacts page with tag filtering, badges, inline editing (port 5173)
- Auth: No users created yet — need to create via Supabase dashboard
- Render: Not yet deployed (env vars needed)
- Studio Flow: Test SID ready, production unchanged

**Issues:**
- No Supabase auth users exist — need to create via dashboard
- Render service not yet deployed
- gh CLI not installed on this machine
- SIP endpoint for operator forwarding not configured

**Next Steps:**
1. Create auth user in Supabase dashboard (lea@lemedspa.com)
2. Deploy API to Render with all env vars
3. Update Studio Flow webhook URLs to Render
4. End-to-end test with test number
5. Deploy Studio Flow to production

  - GET /api/contacts (paginated, filterable, searchable)
  - GET /api/contacts/stats (total + breakdown by source)
  - GET /api/contacts/search (quick autocomplete)
  - GET /api/contacts/:id (detail + recent call history)
  - POST /api/contacts + PATCH /api/contacts/:id
- Built contacts frontend page (`src/routes/(auth)/contacts/+page.svelte`):
  - Source filter tabs with counts (AR, GHL, TextMagic, etc.)
  - Search by name/phone/email
  - Expandable contact cards with details, metadata, call history
  - Pagination
- Added Contacts to sidebar navigation (Users icon)
- Updated all 3 existing pages to show caller names:

  - Call log: same pattern + search includes caller_name
  - Voicemails: caller_name from joined call_logs relation
- Added `scripts/textme.mjs` — Claude Code stop-hook (SMS notification via Twilio)
- All commits pushed to GitHub

**Current State:**
- Database: contacts table live, migration 002 applied, CallerName column on call_logs
- API: All routes working locally (port 3001) — calls, voicemails, contacts, webhooks
- Frontend: Build passes, 5 pages (Dashboard, Calls, Voicemails, Contacts, Settings)
- Twilio Studio Flow: Test SID published with CallerName + geo params (revision 40)
- Contact sync: Script tested, ready for real data (needs CSV export or published sheet)
- Google Sheet: `17QsXyjLGB5b2hUPesyInsVfJ2ME2H_JJi0sDTDxFayo` (patients3 tab, private)

**Issues:**
- Render service not yet deployed (needs env vars configured in dashboard)
- Google Sheet is private — sync requires either CSV export or publishing the tab
- SIP endpoint for operator forwarding not configured (still dials HighLevel number)
- OTP login still accepts hardcoded '000000'
- `0b-Apologize-missed-Elise.wav` not yet wired into any flow state

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy API to Render (configure env vars in dashboard)
2. Update Studio Flow webhook URLs to use Render URL
3. Import real contacts (CSV export from Google Sheet or publish patients3 tab)
4. End-to-end test: call test number → IVR → verify logs + contact matching in dashboard
5. Deploy modified flow to production
6. Wire up "apologize missed" recording if needed

## Session — 2026-02-13 (Session 4)
**Focus:** Studio Flow deployment, new recordings upload, API verification

**Accomplished:**
- Fixed Twilio Studio Flow validation error: `event: 'fail'` → `event: 'failed'` for HTTP Request widgets
- Fixed HTTP Request body format: JSON strings → proper URL-encoded params (Express compatibility)
- Deployed modified flow to test SID (FW9d3adadbd331019576b71c0a586fc491) — published revision 39
- Uploaded 3 new Elise recordings to Twilio Assets (created `lm-ivr-assets` Serverless service):
  - `0a-Main-Elise.wav` — new main greeting
  - `0b-Apologize-missed-Elise.wav` — "sorry we missed your call" (available, not yet wired)
  - `Hours-Location-Elise-wav.wav` — new hours/location recording
  - All hosted at: `lm-ivr-assets-2112.twil.io`
- Updated flow JSON with new recording URLs (replaced periwinkle-partridge → lm-ivr-assets)
- Created `twilio/upload-assets.js` for Twilio Serverless asset management
- Verified all 4 webhook endpoints locally:
  - /incoming → creates call_log, returns 200 (no TwiML) ✅
  - /event → creates call_event linked to call_log ✅
  - /recording → creates voicemail with mailbox param ✅
  - /status, /transcription → unchanged, working ✅
- Committed and pushed all changes

**Current State:**
- Test Studio Flow: Published with 5 HTTP Request widgets + new Elise recordings
- Production Studio Flow: Unchanged (still original, safe)
- API: All webhooks verified working locally (port 3001)
- Render service: `lm-app-api.onrender.com` exists but returns `no-server` — needs env vars + deploy
- Database: All tables ready, tested with mock data (cleaned up)
- Frontend: Build passes, all pages functional

**Issues:**
- Render service not yet fully deployed (needs env vars configured in dashboard)
- SIP endpoint for operator forwarding not configured (still dials HighLevel number)
- OTP login still accepts hardcoded '000000'
- `0b-Apologize-missed-Elise.wav` not yet wired into any flow state
- Need to confirm where "apologize missed" recording should go in the flow

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy API to Render (configure env vars in dashboard)
2. Update Studio Flow webhook URLs to use Render URL
3. End-to-end test: call test number → IVR → verify logs in dashboard
4. Deploy modified flow to production
5. Wire up "apologize missed" recording if needed

## Session — 2026-02-12 (Session 3)
**Focus:** Brainstorming Twilio phone flow + Approach A implementation

**Accomplished:**
- Brainstormed Twilio phone flow architecture — chose Approach A (keep IVR on Twilio Studio, our app is passive logger/dashboard)
- Wrote design doc: `docs/plans/2025-02-12-twilio-phone-flow-design.md`
- Wrote full implementation plan: `docs/plans/2025-02-12-phase1a-implementation.md` (13 tasks)
- DB migration applied: added `mailbox` column to voicemails, created `call_events` table with RLS + indexes
- Rewrote voice.js webhooks for Approach A:
  - /incoming — simplified (no TwiML, just logs call, Studio handles IVR)
  - /event — NEW endpoint for IVR menu navigation tracking
  - /recording — now accepts `mailbox` param from Studio
  - /status + /transcription — unchanged
- Updated voicemails API: added `mailbox` filter, new `/stats` endpoint with per-mailbox unheard counts
- Built voicemails frontend page: mailbox tabs (All/Lea/Clinical MD/Accounts/Care Team), audio player with play/pause, transcription display, search, new/read filters, mark read/unread
- Added Voicemails link to sidebar navigation
- Created Twilio Studio deploy infrastructure: `twilio/deploy.js` script, `twilio/flows/` directory
- Updated `api/db/schema.sql` with call_events table, mailbox column, updated view
- All builds pass, all committed and pushed

**Current State:**
- Database: mailbox column + call_events table live in Supabase (project skvsjcckissnyxcafwyr)
- API: All webhook endpoints ready for Approach A (passive logging from Studio)
- Frontend: Dashboard + Calls + Voicemails pages all functional
- Auth: Email+password login via Supabase (OTP still placeholder)
- Build: `npm run build` succeeds
- Both servers work: API on 3001, SvelteKit on 5173
- .env files configured with Supabase + Twilio credentials

**Next Steps:**
- ✅ Completed in Session 4

## Session — 2026-02-12 (Session 2)
**Focus:** Phase 1A implementation — call logging + voicemail backend + frontend

**Accomplished:**
- Applied full lm-app database schema to Supabase (profiles, call_logs, voicemails, phone_extensions, call_routing_rules, audit_log, settings + RLS + indexes + views)
- Seeded dev data: 1 phone extension (100), 2 routing rules (business hours + after hours), 5 default settings
- Implemented Twilio webhook handlers (voice.js): incoming call → creates call_log, status updates → tracks call lifecycle, recording → creates voicemail, transcription → updates voicemail text
- Wired up call logs API: GET /api/calls (paginated, filterable, sortable), GET /api/calls/stats (dashboard stats + unheard voicemail count), GET /api/calls/:id, POST /api/calls (manual entries), PATCH /api/calls/:id
- Wired up voicemails API: GET /api/voicemails (paginated, filterable, joins call_logs), GET /api/voicemails/:id, PATCH /api/voicemails/:id/read, PATCH /api/voicemails/:id/unread
- Built dashboard page: fetches real stats (total calls, missed, voicemails, avg duration) + recent calls list with skeleton loading states
- Built call log page: search, filter by disposition (all/answered/missed/voicemail), pagination, phone formatting, duration display
- Frontend build passes cleanly, all API syntax checks pass
- Fixed SvelteKit env var issue: switched to `$env/static/public` imports
- Brainstormed Twilio phone flow → chose Approach A (keep Studio IVR)

**Current State:**
- Database: All Phase 1A tables live in Supabase (shared project with timetracker — no conflicts)
- API: All routes fully functional (webhooks + CRUD), using supabaseAdmin for server-side ops
- Frontend: Dashboard + Call Log pages fetch from API, show loading skeletons, handle empty states
- Auth: Email+password login works via Supabase (OTP still placeholder — not blocking)
- Build: `npm run build` succeeds with 0 errors
- .env files: api/.env and root .env configured with all credentials

**Issues:**
- OTP in login still accepts hardcoded '000000' — wire up Resend for real OTP later
- lmappdev/ still needs cleanup (VS lock)

**Next Steps:**
- ✅ Moved to Session 3

---

## Session — 2026-02-12 (Session 1)
**Focus:** Cross-repo alignment analysis + cleanup + sync

**Accomplished:**
- Analyzed all 6 directories in workspace for alignment between plans (lm-docs) and implementation
- Removed duplicate research/guide docs from lm-app/ and lmdev/ root (authoritative copies stay in lm-docs)
- Deleted empty lmwebappdev/ directory (lmappdev/ locked by VS — skip for now)
- Updated lm-docs research: all Netlify references → Cloudflare Pages, design direction updated to dark+gold (archived cream/ivory concept)
- Updated lm-app CLAUDE.md: added Day 1 priority (call logging), design direction (dark+gold), security approach (2FA designed in, ships incrementally)
- Updated workspace CLAUDE.md: lm-app repo now exists, design alignment noted, status updated
- Committed and pushed all 3 repos (lm-app, lm-docs, lmdev)
